[00:14.31] Give me straight gin, 양말 하나 남기지 않고
[00:18.98] 떠난 널 위해, cheers
[00:21.20] Wish you'll saw this, 엉망이 돼 버린 내 자태
[00:26.25] Oh, my baby (ooh-ooh, ooh)
[00:39.25] 
[00:28.65] 실컷 두들겨 맞은 마음 (ooh-ooh, ooh)
[00:32.05] 전부 무너진 꼴 좀 봐 (ooh-ooh, ooh)
[00:35.55] 이 정도 했음 됐잖아요
[00:38.18] Count one to ten, mmh, turn to, turn to my heart
[00:42.52] One, two, three, seven, eight
[00:57.02] 
[00:44.92] My baby Georgia, baby Georgia
[00:48.53] Can't take my eyes off you, my hometown is only you
[00:52.18] Baby Georgia, baby Georgia
[00:55.53] Don't break my home no more, there is nowhere to go
[01:21.03] 
[00:59.50] 십 초, 아니, 십 년을 세어도
[01:03.02] All I want is you, L-O-V-E is you
[01:19.52] 
[01:10.73] 그 여자를 왜 좋아하냐고요? 딱히 이유랄 게 있을까요?
[01:13.68] 그냥 다 좋은데, 뭐 하나를 꼽자면
[01:16.67] 노래를 잘 불러서는 아니고
[01:20.65] Just because, it's 'cause it's you (ooh-ooh, ooh)
[01:45.15] 
[01:24.29] 비가 주르륵 내린 다음 (ooh-ooh, ooh)
[01:27.73] 눈이 사르르 녹은 다음 (ooh-ooh, ooh)
[01:31.27] 그 정도 하고 돌아와요
[01:33.76] Count one to ten, mmh, turn to, turn to my heart
[01:38.25] One, two, three, seven, eight
[01:52.75] 
[01:40.63] My baby Georgia, baby Georgia
[01:44.25] Can't take my eyes off you, my hometown is only you
[01:47.74] Baby Georgia, baby Georgia
[01:51.20] Don't break my home no more, there is nowhere to go
[02:16.70] 
[01:55.06] 십 초, 아니, 십 년을 세어도
[01:58.87] All I want is you, L-O-V-E is you
[02:15.37] 
[02:22.92] 십 초, 아니, 십 년을 세어도
[02:26.78] All I want is you, L-O-V-E is you
[02:36.25] Is you
